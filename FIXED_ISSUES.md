# ✅ FIXED: Port and Image Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Port Mismatch Fixed
**Problem**: Your `NEXTAUTH_URL` was set to `localhost:3001` but dev server runs on `localhost:3000`
**Solution**: Updated `.env` file to use correct port:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 2. ✅ Missing Favicon Fixed
**Problem**: `GET http://localhost:3001/favicon.ico 404 (Not Found)`
**Solution**: Created `public/favicon.ico` and `public/favicon.svg`

### 3. ⚠️ Image URL Issue (Still Needs Your Action)
**Problem**: You're using a page URL instead of direct image URL

✅ Need:  https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxxxx/...
```

## How to Fix Your Image URL

### Step 1: Get the Direct Image URL
1. Go to: `https://unsplash.com/photos/a-black-and-white-abstract-with-concentric-circles-ZI1VF7thzys`
2. Right-click on the image
3. Select "Copy Image Address"
4. You'll get something like: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577563908411-5077b6dc7624?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80`

### Step 2: Test the URL
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/debug/images`
2. Paste your direct image URL
3. Click "Test URL"
4. Should show all green checkmarks ✅

### Step 3: Use in Your Product
1. Go to your product creation form
2. Use the direct image URL (not the page URL)
3. Save the product
4. Images should now display correctly

## Current Status

✅ **Port issue fixed** - No more localhost:3001 errors
✅ **Favicon fixed** - No more favicon 404 errors  
✅ **Image domains configured** - Unsplash URLs are supported
⚠️ **Need direct image URL** - Replace page URL with direct image URL

## Quick Test

1. **Server running**: `http://localhost:3000` ✅
2. **Test image tool**: `http://localhost:3000/debug/images` ✅
3. **Environment fixed**: NEXTAUTH_URL now points to correct port ✅

Your application should now work without the 404 errors. Just make sure to use direct image URLs instead of page URLs when creating products!
